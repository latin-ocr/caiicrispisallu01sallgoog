Tun object of the Publisbers, in having the present work
prepared, was to afford tn the strident a correct, yet cheap
edition of Sallust.

'l'he text, of which this re a reprint, was prepared by
F. D. GerlschP. Ι), Professor of Latinlriteraturc inthe Uni·
versity of Bane-a ripe and able scholar, wbn bas devoted
many years to the study of Sallust, and the eompletion osa
good edition. His text 'a considered by Dr Beck, Professor
of lntin' ιιι Hosvard University‚ who very kindly supplied the
Editor with a copy, as the best exeat-an opinion in which
there' rs very little doubt, most school· ·boys will most heurtily

’ concur, as, for many reasons, this text is eaeier to comune

thau any before published' ιιι this eounhy.

So much for the text: a few words now for the notes. 'rte
objection is very commonly made to notes on the classice, tbct
they give the meet satisfactory explanation of words and sen·
tennes, which the student would have understood just ss well
without any notes at all· while they preserve amon omniunt·
silence about those places which ere really difficult to compre-
bend3 and nothing can be more provoking to ascbool· master
uan such notes as these.

There' rs, undoubwdly much foundation for such objectione,
in many editions of the classice. Itis very easy for an editor
tewinkoutofsightadiffieultpassage, while aneasyons
affords blm a grand opportunity to display his learninga-
much lilre tbe eingeis in our chunebes, whose voices are b
faint when they have any complicated music tn sing3 but when
a plain eadeuce eccum, they shout out with all their snengu.

the variety oi' authority which came within his recob, the wisdom
displayed in judginp between historicnl contradictione, and tbs

agecity evinced in forming opinions from the various menate
presented to him frons which to frame the histnry.

The former cluss must, from its very nature, embrnce but ι
small portion ef time3 but writings os thir kind, from their minute
and rccurste detail, their glowing description, and their reality,
ere more likely to be interesting and amusing thau the other kind,
, compared with which they ara like mering pauoremas by tha side
of still pointings. They are prinoipslly valuable ss forming
mrterinls for the future historiam They rre the pure, original
merces, the very elements, of history. When their truth ironce
accreditedy their vales increases from age tn rge3 und they rs·
quire the same sort ol authority as legal precedents.

To this class of historical writiugs belong tba wcrlrs of su·
tuat. This writer was born so soon aster tbe terminatione os tbs
Jngurthine war, that bewss undoubtedly scqusinted with many
who hed been engaged in it5 and while he held the prestorsbip οἲ
Numidia, he visited the scenes of the most memorabis events irs
the wer, and acquainted himself with the geography of the coun-
try, besides collectiug several original documents, which he
caused tc be translated· into Latin for his own benefit lle sm
thus enabled to give ι minute und graphic description οἰ tha prin·
cipal events in tbe wer. He bad seen the pluces where tbe most
remarkable incidente took place 3 be hed stood on the fields where
tna bloodiest battles hud been fought5 and perhaps learned frons
rome reveren, who had borne his share in the contest, how tha
whole feursul drame had passed-where the armies had been
sindonem-in what order they udrunoed,-cn what spot they
encountercd each other in the auset-where the fierce king or
Numidia had charged with hia formidabis cavalry, - und whither
he retreated when his troops hed spent theirvain fury upon the
ponderous phalanx of the Romans. All the scene was before him,
ns it· he himself had witnessed it. He hnd traversed the nme
piains und wildernesses, crossed the rivers, escended the monn-
trins that lay in the path ot' the Roman army. He bed penetrsted
to tbe distant cities of the desert, surreyed their walls, and scaled
tire clih's whose summits were capped with impregnsble for·
nesse· ; ,und accordingly we lind in his writinpp a vividness ot*
description and a reality which could bs expected imm no cutber
who had not enjoyed equaladvantages.

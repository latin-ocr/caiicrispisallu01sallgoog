second, which ia now before us, appears to have been written with
praetereare, if possible, than the first. finding that volume quoted

ln the second, but aster the most close and re ated investigation.

“Such a work is worth the reading, meritsthe appianae
and the remuneratior which a liberal, an enligbteued, and a patri-
otic people will beetow.’'
